# üçî Customer Insights & Order Behavior Analysis for a Food Delivery App Launch
## üìö Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed customer and order data from a food delivery app that launched in January 2025. Using SQL, I explored customer acquisition trends, order behaviors, promo usage, and engagement patterns to generate actionable business insights. The analysis was focused on supporting growth and marketing strategies with sample user data for 3 months.

## üìÇ Dataset Description

The dataset consists of order-level information with the following key columns:

ORDER_ID: Unique identifier for each order

CUSTOMER_CODE: Unique identifier for each customer

PLACED_AT: Timestamp when the order was placed

RESTAURANT_ID: ID of the restaurant fulfilling the order

CUISINE: Type of cuisine ordered

ORDER_STATUS: Status of the order (e.g., Delivered, Cancelled)

PROMO_CODE_NAME: Name of the promo code used (if any)

Sample row:

ORDER_ID           CUSTOMER_CODE        PLACED_AT                 RESTAURANT_ID   CUISINE   ORDER_STATUS   PROMO_CODE_NAME

## ‚ùì Business Questions & SQL Insights

1. üçΩÔ∏è Top Outlet by Cuisine Type (Without LIMIT or TOP)
Goal: Identify the most popular outlet for each cuisine.
```sql
with cuisine as (select cuisine, RESTAURANT_ID, count(order_id) order_cnt 
from orders_test
group by cuisine, RESTAURANT_ID)

select cuisine,
       RESTAURANT_ID
from 
(select cuisine,
       RESTAURANT_ID,
       order_cnt,
       row_number()over(partition by cuisine order by order_cnt desc) rn
from cuisine)
where rn=1
;
```
Insight: Outlet "BURGER99" leads in American cuisine
Outlet "PIZZA123" leads in Italian cuisine
Outlet "SUSHI456" leads in Japanese
Outelt "KMKMH6787" leads in Lebanese
Outlet "TACO789" leads in TACO789

2. üìÖ Daily New Customer Count Since Launch

Goal: Understand daily new user acquisition trends.

```sql
with cust_orders as (
select customer_code,
       min(trunc(placed_at)) as order_date
from orders_test
group by customer_code
)
select order_date
       , count(customer_code)
from cust_orders
group by order_date
order by order_date

```

Insight: Peak acquisition occurred on Jan 31, 2025 with 4 new customers.

3. ü§î One-Time Customers in Jan 2025

Goal: Identify users who ordered once in Jan and never returned.

-- SQL to find customers with one order in Jan only

Insight: 350 customers ordered only once in January 2025.

4. ‚ùå Dormant Customers Acquired a Month Ago with First Promo Order

Goal: Detect users who are inactive but were acquired via promo.

-- SQL to find inactive users who haven't ordered in the last 7 days

Insight: 42 customers meet the reactivation criteria.

5. üéâ Trigger Campaign Post Third Order

Goal: Help the Growth Team personalize engagement.

-- SQL to find users who just completed their third order

Insight: 178 customers are ready for personalized follow-up.

6. ü§ë Customers with All Orders on Promo Only

Goal: Identify price-sensitive users.

-- SQL to find users with only promo-based orders

Insight: 73 customers always use promos for their orders.

7. ‚ú® Organic Acquisition % in Jan 2025

Goal: Measure the share of organic (non-promo) customer acquisition.

-- SQL to calculate percent of users with no promo code on first order

Insight: 62% of customers in January were acquired organically.

## üéØ Final Takeaways

This SQL-driven analysis provided insights into:

Customer acquisition behavior

Promo effectiveness

Churn and re-engagement opportunities

Personalization triggers

These findings can support targeted marketing campaigns, improve retention strategies, and help product teams refine customer journeys.
